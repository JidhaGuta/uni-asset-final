UniAsset â€“ University Electronics Registration & Tracking System is a mobile-based Flutter application designed to digitize the manual process of registering and verifying
student electronic devices such as laptops, tablets, phones, and wearables. The system enables students to register their devices and generate unique QR codes, 
while security officers can scan these codes for quick verification at campus gates. Admins can manage users and device records through a dashboard. 
The app uses mock data for now and will later integrate with a Node.js backend and MySQL/MongoDB database for real-time data management, image storage, and secure authentication.
